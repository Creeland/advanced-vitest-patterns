# Custom fixtures

## Curiosities

- `use` is _always async_! Await it.
- Fixtures can be anything: values and functions.
- Test context object _must_ be destructed (`test(n, ({ like, so }))`). Vitest (and Playwright) use the getters to know if you've referenced fixtures to initialize them lazily.

## Important

- Do NOT put values you use for input into fixtures.

```ts
test('...', ({ cart }) => {
	// What is `cart`?? Why does it equal to `something` in this case? Idk.
	expect(transform(cart)).toBe(something)
})
```

This is a _bad_ idea. Your test isn't isolated and depends on the fixture. Besides, you don't see the input so you cannot reason about the expected output. Just don't do this.

_Instead_, either create fixtures _inline_ in the test, or use helper fixtures to abstract complex creation logic (but still expose input control through arguments).

- I think you can put a value into a fixture if it's a _domain-specific value_ that is _never going to change_. Otherwise, you're better off.
