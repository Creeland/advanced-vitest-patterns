# Global context

Let's follow up on the previous `createMockDatabase()` fixture and make it better.

By default, when you extend your test context via `test.extend()`, you get a _new `test()` function back_ that you should now explicitly use in tests:

```ts nonumber highlight=1
import { test } from '../test-extend'

test('...', ({ yourFixture }) => {}) // ✅
```

Although this explicitness is nice, consistency would be even better. Forgetting to swap the default `test()` with your own can lead to unexpected behaviors, and if you're exposing `test()` globally via `globals: true`, TypeScript won't catch such mistakes either.

But there's another way.

You can apply your custom `test()` _globally_. This will save you one extra line of import in each test file and also guarantee consistent test context everywhere across the board.

## Your task

👨‍💼 That is precisely what you're going to do in this exercise. Follow the instructions in <InlineFile file="text-extend.ts" /> and <InlineFile file="vitest.config.ts" /> to expose your custom test context globally. Once you've got that covered, refactor the existing tests to rely on the global `test()` function instead.

You got this!
