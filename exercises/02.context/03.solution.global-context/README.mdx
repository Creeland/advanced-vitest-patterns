# Global context

If I want to expose my custom test context in `test-extend.ts` globally, Vitest has to evaluate that module as a part of my setup. So a good place to start it so to add that module to the `setupFiles` in `vitest.config.ts`:

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts add=6
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		globals: true,
		setupFiles: ['./test-extend.ts'],
	},
})
```

<callout-success>Adding `test-extend.ts` to `setupFiles` means Vitest will run it as a part of the test setup. This is _one piece_ to not having to import it explicitly.</callout-success>

Now, I need to refactor the way my test context is declared, moving it from a local `test` variable to a global `globalThis.test()` function.

In `test-extend.ts`, I will augment the module declaration for `vitest` to automatically infer the types for my `Fixtures` onto the default `test()` function:

```ts filename=test-extend.ts add=7-9
interface Fixtures {
	createMockDatabase: (
		seed: (database: Database, handle: CallbackHandle) => void,
	) => Promise<void>
}

declare module 'vitest' {
	export interface TestContext extends Fixtures {}
}
```

Next, it's time to change the type definitions for the global `test()` function.

When you're using `vitest/globals` in your TypeScript configuration, that exposes functions like `test()` and `expect()` globally, providing the necessary type definitions. Overriding the types for those functions, however, is currently impossible since they are declared as _constants_:

```ts filename=vitest/globals.d.ts highlight=2-3
declare global {
	const test: (typeof import('vitest'))['test']
	const expect: (typeof import('vitest'))['expect']
	// ...
}
export {}
```

Not to worry. Since I've extended the regular test context in `interface TestContext extends Fixtures`, all I have to do is annotate `globalThis.test` as the imported `testBase` explicitly.

```ts filename=test-extend.ts add=13-15 highlight=1
import { test as testBase } from 'vitest'

interface Fixtures {
	createMockDatabase: (
		seed: (database: Database, handle: CallbackHandle) => void,
	) => Promise<void>
}

declare module 'vitest' {
	export interface TestContext extends Fixtures {}
}

declare namespace globalThis {
	var test: typeof testBase
}
```

> `testBase` now has its `TestContext` augmented by my custom `Fixtures` interface. Overriding the type definition for global test as `typeof testBase` means that the custom context is also exposed to the global context!

Now, all is left is to refactor the existing tests to remove the explicit `test` import from `test-extend.ts` and rely on the global `test()` function instead:

```ts remove=1
import { test } from '../test-extend'
import { queryUser } from './query-user'
```

And we're done! ðŸŽ‰
