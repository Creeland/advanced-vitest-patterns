# Code coverage

1. Install `@vitest/coverage-v8`.
1. Set `test.coverage.enabled` to `true`.
1. List explicit values in `test.coverage.include` to make Vitest faster.

Then, to preview the coverage:

1. Install `@vitest/ui`.
1. Run Vitest in the UI mode: `npx vitest --ui` (or set `test.ui` to `true`).
1. Make sure to include `html` in the `test.coverage.reporters` list (you can still use other reporters).
1. In the UI, go to the "Coverage" tab. See the coverage.
