# Performance

## Important defaults

- Vitest isolates each test _file_ (e.g. each test file runs in its own fork/worker/vm).
- Vitest runs test _files_ concurrently.
- Test cases in test files run _sequentially_ (thus a designated `test.concurrent()`).

## Where to start

1. Understand the difference between _parallelism_ and _concurrency_.
