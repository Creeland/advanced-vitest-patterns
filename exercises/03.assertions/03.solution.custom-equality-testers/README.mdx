# Custom equality testers

- [docs](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#expect-addequalitytesters)
- Unlike matchers, equality testers are _applied recursively_! This is extremely useful if your custom data structure is nested in some other data structure.
- Gotcha: Equality testers must be _synchronous_.

Really neat way to define equality testers to compare otherwise incomparable objects, like `Response`. - `Response` isn't the best example because equality testers _must be synchronous_.

## TODO

- [ ] Better name for the test. We aren't testing the `Measurement` class but something that uses it.
